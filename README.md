# Combination Technical Test

Welcome to Combination's technical test. **Please read this whole document carefully before beginning**.

In this test, you are provided with the following:

- A specification document (Specification.pdf) detailing the expected behavior of a simple game. The game follows the traditional rules of Tetris most people are familiar with, but we've included a specification of the whole game as a reference.
- A TypeScript project containing a starting point for the implementation of the game.

Your task is to implement the game according the the specification document.

## External tools

You are free to access any web resources but expected to be able to explain and reason about your choices and solutions.

## Evaluation

The test is meant to evaluate your programming and problem-solving skills. Runnable (and bug-free) code is always preferred over good reasoning where applicable.

## Running the application

Make sure node 16 or higher is installed, run `npm install` to install all the packages.
In order to run the application in dev mode, run `npm run dev`.

## Development container

For convenience, and in order to avoid potential problems with mismatching versions on NodeJS, npm or other tooling, a `devcontainer.json` is included. This allows running and developing the application inside a docker container with the VS Code [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) feature.
